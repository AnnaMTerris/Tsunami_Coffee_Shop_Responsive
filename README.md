# Responsive website for a fictional coffee shop, called Tsunami Coffee Shop
## Main purpose of the project is to learn advanced CSS styles, especially focusing on making a website responsive. Step-by-step instructions were provided by Codecademy to make the site responsive. 
 The following changes were executed to make the page responsive:
+ Changing hard-coded units to rem and %
+ Adding media queries to adapt the layout to different screen sizes
+ Fixed issues with general layout, spacing and image sizes
### By utilising git and publishing the final project on Github, I practised version control through the inbuilt terminal in VS code. Furthermore, transferring the code to VS code meant I had to practise creating folder structure and linking CSS files to html file.
#### Project uses HTML and CSS.
##### Original code and images were provided by Codecademy. 
+ CSS reset stylesheet from normalize.css v5.0.0 | MIT License | github.com/necolas/normalize.css
